#+title: Cloud Games Reach

* Lauren walkthrough for games reach
** Two types of requests:
*** Projecting Smart TV reach 2024, 2025, 2026
Previously: Samsung, LG, Sony, Amazon, Google
We know Roku is also committed now.
Add devices as devices are added to whats available

*** We know which devices are cloud games enabled -- what is the reach of those devices in active members and which regions are those located in?
When should we launch beta in which territories, what languages, what rating?
Look at NRDP/Android holistically, then look at the devices that get actived for cloud games and look at the distribution
