#+title: svg path

The = =<path>'= is the most powerful SVG element to create lines, curves, arcs, and more.

The shape of =path= is set by one parameter =d=.  Each command in =d= is instantiated by a specific letter.  For example =M= tells it to move to a specific x and y coordinate.  Each command has two variants.  An uppercase letter means to move to /absolute/ coordinates and a lowercase letters means to move to /relative/ coordinates.

Vertical and horizontal lines are drawn using H and V.  They take one parameters since you are only moving in one direction.
