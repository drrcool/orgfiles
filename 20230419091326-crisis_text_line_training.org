#+title: Crisis Text Line Training

* Five stage philosophy
This is process that each conversation will go through.


** Build Rapport
- We want to establish trust with the texter.  We begin to learn what lead them to reach out.
- How we introduce ourselves and set the tone for the conversation

** Explore
- give the texter room to open up about their crisis
- are they at risk of harming themselves, others, or being harmed by someone else
- especially focused on feelings

** Identify the Goal
- ask what they hope comes next
- we work with the text to help identify what part of the crisis is the most important in the moment
- transition from reflecting on past to the present

** Discover Next Steps
- Continue to manage their emotions after the conversation ends
- Brain storm and identify things they can do to work on their crisis
- possibilities:
  - journally
  - doctor
  - call support

** End the conversation
- reflect on the progress and reiterate coping skills


* Empathy, Active Listening, and Tone

** Empathy:
being there with the texter, atempting to step into their shoes without preteneding that we understand exactly what it's like to walk in them

*** Sympathy:
- We aren't feeling sorry for the texter and expressing regret for their situation. We don't pity them, and we don't try and distance ourselves from how difficult the situation is.
- We stay away from phrases like "I'm sorry" because that shows sympathy.

** Active Listening
- While listening just to respond, we miss the opportunity to really hear the texter and show them that we care
- Active listening on text requires careful reading and making the response about them, not us.
- When we focus on ourselves, we aren't present and connected to the texters, which is what they need most.

** Warm tone
*** Good Contact Techniques:
Show we are empathetic and care about them.

**** Reflections
- Rephrase what you've heard to be sure you correctly understand what's been said.
- This is not parroting --- repeating the same thing the texter said.  Instead, we take the time to read and then summarize their thoughts in our own words
- When to use:
  - Double check that you understand correctly or to summary large chunks of information
- *Takeaway*: take a moment to process what a texter shares, then reflect your understanding using *your own words*

**** Strong Feeling Words
- Describe and express a texter's emotions
- Devastated versus upset
- Help label emotions assoicated with the crisis a texter is sharing.
- When to use
  + after texters share facts about their situation without sharing much about how it's impacting them.
  + when texters are minimizing their own emotions as a way to show them that the converstation is a safe space to express how they're truly feeling
- *Takeaway*: watch the feeling word with the intensity of the texter's strong emotions.  Using a weak word can minimize their experience.

| afraid       | frustrated  | mortified     |
| agitatedly   | furious     | overwhelmed   |
| angry        | guarded     | panicked      |

| ashamed      | helpless    | rejected      |
| confused     | hesitant    | scared        |
| defeated     | hopeless    | shocked       |
| depressed    | horrified   | terrified     |

| empty        | irritated   | vulternable   |

**** Tentafiers
- Come before strong emotions to make them tenative
- It seems
- I wonder
- Gauge how they are feeling
- help us avoid mnaking assumptions
- should be used with strong feeling words or thoughts to get clarity on how the texter is feeling
- we're not telling them how they feel, but instead, leaving the in charge to confirm or deny and expand
- When to use
  + more complex and subtle subjects
  + when you're unsure what the texter is saying or feeling
  + avoid using this if the meaning is clear
- *Takeaway*: help us clarify how texters are feeling while leaving them in control.  Without tenatfiers, we can come across as an authority figure that isn't really listening.

Tenatifier example
| It seems like ...                   | I get the feeling that you ...             |
| I wonder if ...                     | I hear you saying that ...                 |
| It sounds like ...                  | If I understand you right, you ...         |
|I'm hearing that ..                  | Let me see if I'm with you so far; you ... |
| I'm curious if ...                  | I'm getting the impression ...             |
| So, you're feeling ...              | Would it be accurate to say that you ...   |
| I hear you're feeling ...           | I'm sensing that you ...                   |
| You seem to be feeling ...          | I get the impression that ...              |
| My hunch is that you're feeling ... | I'm thinking that you ....                 |
| I wonder if you're feeling ...      |                                            |

**** Validations
- Validate their feelings and experiences
- it makes sense to feel frustrated when things don't seem to be working
- enourages them to open up further
- accept a texter's emotions and crisis without judgement
- used to prefact difficult emotions, thoughts, or experiences
- When to use
  + when a texter has just described a difficult emotion or challenging experience
  + it lets them know what they are feeling are normall.
- *takeaway*: validations need to be specific to be effective.  Connect the validating phrase to the texters throughts, feelings, and experiences so that it feels more meaningful to their situation.

  Validations
  | It's normal to ...                    | It's normal to feel ..                |
  | It's understandable to feel ...       | You're going through a lot.           |
  | It makes sense to ...                 | It can be overwhelming to             |
  | It's natural to ...                   | That's a lot for one person to handle |
  | it's reasonable to ...                | Going through __ can be intense       |
  | that's a difficult situation          | It can be awful to                    |
  | it makes sense why you're feeling ... | There's no wonder that                |
  | it's understanding that you're        | it can often be confusing when        |





**** Strength IDs
- identify texter's strengths
- it was brave to reach out today
- Identify their strengths through what they shared
- Connect a positive trait to an action the texter has taken.
- When to use:
  + Any stage
  + Should relate directly to something they said
- *Takeaway*: when telling a texter something positive about themeselves, avoid being vague or generic. Praise without context can seem empty

  
Some Strength IDs:
| Courage                 |
| Stength                 |
| Insight                 |
| Inspiring, hard working |
| compassion              |
| resilient               |
| self-aware              |
| committed               |
| bravery                 |
| smart                   |
| caring, character       |
| effort                  |


**** Open ended questions
- How long have you been dealing with this?
- Explore the situation and helps the texter to share
- Dig a little
- start with how, what, when, and who
- why questions can come across as judgemental so we avoid them
- When to use them:
  + throughout
  + most useful when you need to understand a texter's feeling and thoughts better
- We avoid asking too many questions in a row.  This leaves the texter feeling interogated
- *Takeaway* : asking for more information lets the texter expand on their feelings

  Open ended questions:
  | What have you tried to deal with ...                                |
  | how did XYZ make you feel                                           |
  | when do you feel that way                                           |
  | how have you made decisions like this in the past                   |
  | if you had a friend going through similar what might you tell them? |
  | what do you usuallydo when                                          |
  | how long have you een feeling this way                              |




*** Why important?
It may be hard to tell what to do in a crisis, so our messages need to be as warm and empathetic as possible.  The techniques give us the information we need to provide the warm and empathetic method.

* Understanding Risk

** Risk: Liklihood of a texter being in immediate danger

* Starting with warmth
