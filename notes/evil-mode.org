#+title: Evil Mode

A list of notes for the different modes:

** Evil Lion
*** Align columns
This package lets you align text.  The syntax uses =gl= to left align and =gL= to right align. Then you enter the text definition motion.  Finally enter the separator symbol.

test = 2
union = 02
super_big_word = 54

becomes (with =glip== using the =ip= inner paragraph text object)

test           = 2
union          = 02
super_big_word = 54

* Additional Text Objects
** =B= -- any block object delimited by braces, parens,or brackely
** =f= -- function
** =g= -- the entire buffer
** =q= -- quotes of amy kind
