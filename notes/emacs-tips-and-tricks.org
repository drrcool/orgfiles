** Doom Emacs
***   Faster startups with the daemon
    You can start the emacs daemon with `emacs --daemon` on the command line.  Then if you do `emacsclient -c` you would get a new frame very quickly.  This ends to be faster than starting new frames each time.
   + `emacsclient -e "(kill-emacs)"
     +  this kills the main emacs server. Any  other deamons than the primary will stay running
