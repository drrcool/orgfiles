#+title: QoEDash Reinvented Backend

* The current back end struggles with the barrage of requests on page load
* I suspect more than needed queries are fired.
** On startup we fetch 2.5Mb of data.  A huge number of filter files are transfered
** There has to be a better way of this. One Api call could do it, if we had it.
*** IDEA explore the possibilities of adding a sync filter data service
* The problem is sporatic. Right now things run smoothly.  Maybe this isn't urgent.
