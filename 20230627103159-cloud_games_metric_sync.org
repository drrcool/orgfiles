#+title: Cloud Games Metric Sync
* TODAY
** TODO Get colors to match between the timeseries and the bar charts
* QoEDash aggregate views
** Open Questions:
*** How to do the aggregation:
**** Druid
    - Gets us tdigest automagically and allows for quick percentiles
    - How hard is hyper log log?
    - Dana, Chris, and Andy have experience with HyperLogLog
    - Post in team channel to get some information
    - Dimensions to track value ranges and then use that to filter before making the tdigest


**** Presto
    Have to either aggregate on query or pre-aggregate and do something like mean or median of percentiles


*** Which metrics to track:
**** CTGL
**** Bitrates
**** Delay Components
**** gameplay_secs
**** gameplay_secs / successful_session
**** active_devices
**** continuous_dropped_frames
**** dropped_frames / hour

*** Dimensions
**** Display dimensions
**** Controller dimensions
***** TODO decide how to handle the case when we have multiple controllers connected in one session.
This will probably have different implications when we have multiplayer games.
**** Geo
**** Game Title dimension
**** OCGA Dims
***** TODO decide which OCGA dimensions are of most use here


* Sessionwiz:
** Custom view
** Dynamic smoothing
** Masking


* Open Questions to talk to people about:
** TODO Do we need bots at all anymore?
** TODO How do we track controllers when multiple are used in one session in our dashboards?  Initial controller type?
