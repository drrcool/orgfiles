#+title: Quote -- T. Roosevelt -- Envious Lives

Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty ... I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life.  I have envied a great many peope who lead difficult lives and led them well.

Theodore Roosevelt
