**  While the build starts the server, it doesn't actually use the build for the website.  Looking at the directory, the build directory is not present. I don't know if this is expected (and we should be running a local build) or it should be getting this from the artifactory.
** Running npm run build seems to generate the files we need.
** For now, I'm going to add =npm run build= to the start.sh script
