#+title: Gratitude Lists

* July 31 2023
1. For making is back home safe, even with some long delays.
2. For a great weekend with Manny.  Everyday together is like an answer to years of prayers.
3. For a light meeting day to get back in the swing of things.
4. For a tight deadline in the next few weeks to get me agile and tactical with what I'm working on.
5. For the fellows who took my committments while I was out and agreed to speak for me this week.
