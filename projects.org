* Sessionwiz
** Viz System:
*** Need to choose between Vega, VizKit, or ChartJS
*** ChartJS pros:
**** it's popular
**** a lot of community support
**** do we need that though?
*** Vega
**** Is it worth it to port the streaming views?  If not, then having two styles isn't ideal.
**** But vega is just about as far from paved-path as we can get
**** Con: Don't need copies of the data for each layer. This won't scale for gaming
*** VizKit:
**** great opportunity to provide chartTypes
**** in house, how long until we stop updating it again?
** Connecting to the new database:
*** From tcat source:
