#+title: Hawkins Notes

Hawkins is a netflix internal ui library for creating uniform styled apps across the company. Here we outline the use of some of the features.

* Querybuilder
** Ideal for quick generation of filter list or other options in a dashboard.
***** In essence, the second box (first in the first row) of a row lets you choose the dimension you are filtering
***** The first box (omitted in the first row) lets you choose if this new addition is an AND or an OR filte
***** each row has an Opertor that allows you to specify what  to with the values (inclusive or exclude filters)
***** Finally, the last box lets you choose values (or enter values or select a single value, depending on the config)
** Required Props:
*** Conjunctions:
- Amazingly documented as "conjunctions"

*** fieldConfig:
- the Hawkins documentation continues to impress "fieldConfig"
****  Format:
#+BEGIN_SRC typescript
// Here genre, buildingTeams, and query are the three parameters users can
// customize
fieldConfig = {
  genre: {
    uiType: 'Dropdown',
    options: [ {value: 'test', label: 'test label'}], //[ standard optionsList {value:, label:} ]
  },
  buyingTeam: {
    uiType: "MultiSelect",
    options: [] // standard optionsList
  },
  query: {
    uiType: 'Input'
  }
}
#+END_SRC

*** uiTypeConfig:
- who the fuck knows
- from the example, this configures component renderers for each of the ui components
