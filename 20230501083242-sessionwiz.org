* Outstanding Tasks
** TODO Create query to find sessions of interest
** TODO Create session finder
** TODO Loader: the modal has a very small entry for the gsid
** TODO Loader: the modal errors when you try to use it to fetch a session
When I tried this today on my laptop, it didn't error out.  That said, we need to figure out a  better way to try and get user feedback into the UI as you seem to sit there for a decade once the data fetch starts.
** TODO View: Two Views: Custom where we use the existing tooling
*** TODO create grid view
*** TODO create metric selector
*** TODO create option for metric type:
**** Raw metric
**** Difference metric
**** Ratio metric

** TODO mask out data for the histograms
** TODO check that a session is the proper formatting
** TODO When we add a new session, it augments the existing sessionList instead of overwritting
** TODO add units to charts
