* TODO Setup time with Ayesha about NRDP versioning
Notes from sync with Daniel:
- DPI version will be replacing validation version.  This will report 4.1, 4.2, etc.
- will flow into the remodeled =dse.device_client_rollup_d=
** TODO: Ask add =nrdapp_version= to qoedash views


* TODO look at jigsaw failures
SCHEDULED: <2023-05-02 Tue>
** Outstanding Tasks:
*** TODO Check on Jigsaw jobs.
DEADLINE: <2023-05-03 Wed>
All have been updated to a lower concurrency method.  We should check on them tomorrow and see if they ran successfully.
Most of them are running, but some are still failing
*** TODO Migrate meson to meastro
The docs all say I can just move meson create to meastro create, but create is also deprecated.  I need to figure out the right method for deploying it.
*** TODO write a doc for Swapna's team on how to use jigsaw
Include how to create workflows
how to add metrics / remove metrics
Potential wins for the pipeline

* TODO Finish training videos
DEADLINE: <2023-05-03 Wed>

* TODO Take back ownership of tables that Chris published while I was out
DEADLINE: <2023-05-18 Thu>
** https://data.netflix.net/workflows/prod:PRODUCT_QUALITY_SCORE
** https://data.netflix.net/workflows/prod:TABLEAU.STR.EMAIL_DREDASH_MON_THUR_REPORTS.WF
* Cloud Games Dashboard
*** Come up with a plan for viz on daily reports:
**** People interested:
- Alex G
- Daniel Chia
- Bernadette
- vache
- chris wein

**** Daily aggregates of:
- Success and Failures
  - split by human and bot
- Some sort of breakdown by error code
- high level QoE measures

**** Filter information:
- OCGA
- Country
- quant_type (not sure what this means, maybe they mean controller type)

**** TODO Setup time for this group

**** Resources:
- Bernadette's [[https://stash.corp.netflix.com/projects/GDE/repos/cloud-games-beta-report/browse][code repo]] for her daily reports
*** Meeting Notes:  Cloud Games Dashboard
**** Employee beta: expected 450 people
**** Would love to have more information about the funnel about failures
What part of the flow are people failing out.
**** Add more QoE Metrics to the view to add some parity with CDQoE
**** Steering metrics
Are we delivering content from in-region servers instead of from the US
Do we have metrics about this?
** Outstanding Asks:
*** TODO Add permalinking to the dashboard
*** TODO investigate -- device_names
SCHEDULED: <2023-05-19 Fri>
**** Digging into this, it looks like all the -- device_names are all cases where display.vesn and display.device_type_id are coming through as null
*** STUDY Add memory of last filters used
*** TODO Add All/None to the filters
*** TODO split out successful starts vs successful sessions

* PQS Data explorer
** Data explorer seems to fail when we choose a PQS metric

* Integrate metrics into RTCloudGaming
** Adding second screen controller metrics into measures library (Vache)
*** Now added them into RT QOE
*** Hardest part: understanding what metrics to make from them
**** How to normalize
**** What to split by
**** Mantis ASL:
***** stack language
****** Each Comma separates a command
*** To edit the code, click the edit code button.
**** Code is in a JSON blog
**** Undertoolbar, each entry in the list is a row of controls
***** can also be unique to a specific tab
**** Views are the tabs
**** All the queries are held in one central location, you can then use the title of the cell to find the query you need.
**** query is the same ASL used in Atlas
**** winDirection directs the user to which direction is a "win" for the metric
**** When splitting by a aggregate, we want to specify the legend
***** Legend query
****** $(maxControllers), :legend
*******
**** Then use the title from the query config to add it to the dashboard
*** Adding Dimensions:
**** Copy from another dimension and then edit
***** tag = dimensionName
***** adhoc: do we want users to be able add a value?
***** selectAll: select all matching values from a search value
***** noListFilter: don't need to refresh the filter whenever someone starts to type
*** Adding a binned distribution:
**** For percentile metrics, the :sum gives the count


* True crashes:
** some backgrounds are shown in dex : 2026
** How are they making it through the true crashes
** Are they making it into PQS



* Lauren walkthrough for games reach
** Two types of requests:
*** Projecting Smart TV reach 2024, 2025, 2026
Previously: Samsung, LG, Sony, Amazon, Google
We know Roku is also committed now.
Add devices as devices are added to whats available

*** We know which devices are cloud games enabled -- what is the reach of those devices in active members and which regions are those located in?
When should we launch beta in which territories, what languages, what rating?
Look at NRDP/Android holistically, then look at the devices that get actived for cloud games and look at the distribution

* Q3 Plan:
** Gaming Dashboard support
    Core development through PM1
** QoEDash integration of Crashes and Errors
** Explore PQS metric definitions


* TODO add =plan_id= to QoEdash aggs
https://netflix.slack.com/archives/G01G7AE9ASW/p1689375768016429

* TODO check for some PIN failures which are not being excluded from qoedash aggs

All of these sessions are web.

These are a new error code 1007.  We will need to update our logic to grab these and filter them out.  Chris doesn't think a backfill is needed


* DONE check for sesions that seem user-abandoned in the pre-start phase

It looks like these are incorrectly labeled as failed.  The logic will be added to nrjds and then should flow through without any work on my  end.

* TODO Some PBEs which are never sessionized don't make it into PQS

For sessions that are never sessionized, we get PBEs that don't land in playback_f.  For PQS, we do a left join between the PBE fact table and playback_f (so that we can be sure we don't count sessions that already were included via playback_f, but this wouldn't apply to non-sessionized sessions).   The question is how much does this matter?  Most of the errors of this type are manifest errors, which happen a significant amount on some platforms like iOS.  This has resulted in cases where the overall playback error rate for these devices has changed over time, but the PQS has remained flat (since the errors that are being reduced are not actually contributing to PQS in the first place).

* Meeting with Paulson
 - Audio packet loss is a map (and video packet loss).
   - FrameID to count
   - Audio frame arrival offsets are useful
