* TODO Setup time with Ayesha about NRDP versioning
Notes from sync with Daniel:
- DPI version will be replacing validation version.  This will report 4.1, 4.2, etc.
- will flow into the remodeled =dse.device_client_rollup_d=
** TODO: Ask add =nrdapp_version= to qoedash views


* TODO look at jigsaw failures
SCHEDULED: <2023-05-02 Tue>
** Outstanding Tasks:
*** TODO Check on Jigsaw jobs.
DEADLINE: <2023-05-03 Wed>
All have been updated to a lower concurrency method.  We should check on them tomorrow and see if they ran successfully.
Most of them are running, but some are still failing
*** TODO Migrate meson to meastro
The docs all say I can just move meson create to meastro create, but create is also deprecated.  I need to figure out the right method for deploying it.
*** TODO write a doc for Swapna's team on how to use jigsaw
Include how to create workflows
how to add metrics / remove metrics
Potential wins for the pipeline

* TODO Finish training videos
DEADLINE: <2023-05-03 Wed>

* TODO Take back ownership of tables that Chris published while I was out
DEADLINE: <2023-05-18 Thu>
** https://data.netflix.net/workflows/prod:PRODUCT_QUALITY_SCORE
** https://data.netflix.net/workflows/prod:TABLEAU.STR.EMAIL_DREDASH_MON_THUR_REPORTS.WF
* Cloud Games Dashboard
*** Come up with a plan for viz on daily reports:
**** People interested:
- Alex G
- Daniel Chia
- Bernadette
- vache
- chris wein

**** Daily aggregates of:
- Success and Failures
  - split by human and bot
- Some sort of breakdown by error code
- high level QoE measures

**** Filter information:
- OCGA
- Country
- quant_type (not sure what this means, maybe they mean controller type)

**** TODO Setup time for this group

**** Resources:
- Bernadette's [[https://stash.corp.netflix.com/projects/GDE/repos/cloud-games-beta-report/browse][code repo]] for her daily reports
*** Meeting Notes:  Cloud Games Dashboard
**** Employee beta: expected 450 people
**** Would love to have more information about the funnel about failures
What part of the flow are people failing out.
**** Add more QoE Metrics to the view to add some parity with CDQoE
**** Steering metrics
Are we delivering content from in-region servers instead of from the US
Do we have metrics about this?
** Outstanding Asks:
*** TODO Add permalinking to the dashboard
*** TODO investigate -- device_names
SCHEDULED: <2023-05-19 Fri>
**** Digging into this, it looks like all the -- device_names are all cases where display.vesn and display.device_type_id are coming through as null
*** STUDY Add memory of last filters used
*** TODO Add All/None to the filters
*** TODO split out successful starts vs successful sessions

* PQS Data explorer
** Data explorer seems to fail when we choose a PQS metric

* Integrate metrics into RTCloudGaming
** Adding second screen controller metrics into measures library (Vache)
*** Now added them into RT QOE
*** Hardest part: understanding what metrics to make from them
**** How to normalize
**** What to split by
**** Mantis ASL:
***** stack language
****** Each Comma separates a command
*** To edit the code, click the edit code button.
**** Code is in a JSON blog
**** Undertoolbar, each entry in the list is a row of controls
***** can also be unique to a specific tab
**** Views are the tabs
**** All the queries are held in one central location, you can then use the title of the cell to find the query you need.
**** query is the same ASL used in Atlas
**** winDirection directs the user to which direction is a "win" for the metric
**** When splitting by a aggregate, we want to specify the legend
***** Legend query
****** $(maxControllers), :legend
*******
**** Then use the title from the query config to add it to the dashboard
*** Adding Dimensions:
**** Copy from another dimension and then edit
***** tag = dimensionName
***** adhoc: do we want users to be able add a value?
***** selectAll: select all matching values from a search value
***** noListFilter: don't need to refresh the filter whenever someone starts to type
*** Adding a binned distribution:
**** For percentile metrics, the :sum gives the count


* True crashes:
** some backgrounds are shown in dex : 2026
** How are they making it through the true crashes
** Are they making it into PQS
