**** People interested:
- Alex G
- Daniel Chia
- Bernadette
- vache
- chris wein

**** Daily aggregates of:
- Success and Failures
  - split by human and bot
- Some sort of breakdown by error code
- high level QoE measures

**** Filter information:
- OCGA
- Country
- quant_type (not sure what this means, maybe they mean controller type)

**** Resources:
- Bernadette's [[https://stash.corp.netflix.com/projects/GDE/repos/cloud-games-beta-report/browse][code repo]] for her daily reports

**** Steering metrics

** Outstanding Asks:
