#+title: Create a Clean Git Log

1.  Ensure your working branch has all the changes from =main= and has no conflicts.
   #+begin_src sh
git rebase main
#+end_src

2. Create a patch file from your working branch to main.  In this example, our working branch is =feature/refactor_charts=
   #+begin_src sh
git diff main feature/refactor_charts > ~/qoedash_refactor_charts.diff.patch
   #+end_src

3. Checkout main with =git checkout main=

4. Create a new branch to work from
   #+begin_src shell
git checkout -b feature/refactor_charts_clean
   #+end_src

5. Apply the change file
   #+begin_src shell
git apply ~/qoedash_refactor_charts.diff.patch
   #+end_src

Now all changes are in the new branch and uncommitted.
