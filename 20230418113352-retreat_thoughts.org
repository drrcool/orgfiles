#+title: Retreat Thoughts
Thoughts from the NORCAL CMA retreat on the weekend of April 14, 2023.


"We are all survivors of the same near fatal tragedy"

"I was often seeking connection. Let me tell you, dealers had connections.  People would do anything we wanted if we were holding."

"I'm like a bull, if I see a red flag, I run right at it. "
