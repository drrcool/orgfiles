I haven't really journaled since coming back from LA.  CMALA was pretty fucking amazing.  It's crazy how much love and acceptance there is in this community, especially given where we all came from.  I had many moments of breakdowns and raw emotions, and I always felt safe and supported.  I learned a lot about myself and my addiction that will make my recovery ever stronger.  Most importantly, I handled problems that would have once baffled me with grace.  Sure, I needed to step away from time to time to handle some emotional reactions, but after a breath and a little crying, I was able to return and go on with my day.  When I needed alone time, I felt empowered to take it and regroup.

The three main speakers were all fucking amazing.  None of them had my same story (but does anyone?) but I found myself in all three.  All three were former dealers, and the second especially talked about how he had to /do more/ to make amends for that, and that really hit home for me.   I need to do more.   Sadly a lot of the roles that resonate with me require significantly more clean time than I have, so I will have to be patient, and take roles that may be less fun in the meantime.

Dylan also kept coming up.  Fuck that was hard.  But I treated each person I had to tell that he was gone the same way the people in the rooms treated me when I found out. With as much love and compassion as I could put together.  But I managed the pain and grief.  This keeps happening -- I am handling situations that used to baffle me.
