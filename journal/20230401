**Just for Today**:
"Loving relationships are within my reach. Today, I will examine the effects of addiction on my relationships so that I can begin seeking recovery."
**In this moment**:
"In this moment, I speak up for myself."

Both of the readings for today are very appropriate for me.  In past relationships, my people pleasing ruled how I behaved.  I didn't speak up for myself, I didn't feel empowered to speak up for myself.  Often, I would force my partner to play guessing games to figure out what I wanted and that was bad for both -- I didn't get what I wanted and I was hurt so I took it out on them and they were hurt.  My self-centeredness ruled relationships while I was also trying to please everyone.

Similarly, historically I've used relationships as an avenue to "fix" me.  Not anymore.  Now, I am a fully fledged human all by myself; a relationship should complement me and augment what I already have, not fill a void that I haven't been able to fill for myself.

I'm grateful to be with someone that does that.  Through working the steps, I have found a self-confidence and self-worth. I have also found safety and serenity through a connection with a higher power.  Manny makes me feel good about myself and brings a great level of safety, but that is in addition to what I have already on my own.  He doesn't complete me, but takes me to a whole new level.

* Checking in

Today has been wonderful.  Manny took me to breakfast and then we went to Costco mainly to just look around. I ended up getting like $300 in groceries and he paid for them.  WTF?.  Whenever I'm around him, I feel the love flowing off of him onto me.   I can't wait to get the chance to meet his friends.  We have the best time together, I imagine they must be just as great.

Last night he came over and we had sex.  Holllly shit.   I came so hard i was shaking.  And I was messy and he didn't care.  I need to eat more fiber!

Recovery wise, I'm on the 9th step.  Starting that hit me like a truck. There's a lot of work to do here.  A lot of letters to write, conversations to have.  for the first time, I feel like I want to take a break from the steps.  I just need to keep moving forward, but give myself grace when it gets hard.  Because it will.

Dylan's goodbye letter hits me just thinking about it.  That will be a gut wrencher. My dad will also be quite difficult.  I am torn between doing them first to get them taken care of or last.

In personal projects, I got the nanoleafs up. I need to get a few more connectors and stickies to fully finish it.



* 1. Did I stay sober?
Yes
* 2. Did I connect with people?
Yes, Chuckie and especially Manny

* 3. Did I react to people or situations out of resentment or fear?
I had some fear about what Manny was doing in Salinas.  I don't know where this comes from; he's given me nothing but reasons to trust him.  I think its remnants of my trauma from Jeremy combined with knowing that Manny cheated a lot previously (but so did I, so why can I assume I'm good intended when I don't for him).  God knows I see temptation.  These meds are making my sex drive high as fuck, but I haven't acted on them, so I'm not projecting.  But I know I'm capable of it and so is he.  So this is clearly just fear.

* 4. Did I hold myself accountable to anyone?
I talked to Manny about if I owe him Amends.  I also was accountable to the entire group when I was nominated as Greeter.

* 5. Did I remember to be gentle on myself when I fell into old habits?
I try to, but I need more practice.  I often feel an urge to act out,  but never give in.  The fact I'm having the urge bothers me a lot.

* 6. Did I do something that was hard for me?
Taking a saturday committment is hard for my personal life.  But I need to be of service.

* 7. Did I forgive someone?
I forgive people everyday when the old resentments come up.  I had a moment remembering Jeremy yesterday and remembering where I am because of his trauma helped me let it go.

* 8. Did I apologize to anyone and clean up my mess?
For minor things, but I don't think there were major problems yesterday.

* 9. Did I show up for myself and take care of my business?
I am working on my step and journaling, so that definitely counts.

* 10. Did I stay in touch with my Higher Power?
I didn't meditate or actively pray, so I can improve here.

* 11. Did I help anyone today?
I helped with the meeting, being of service is key.
