* Highlights
** Step  1:
- We call this reaching a spiritual bottom. Without reaching one, we would have kept cycling through relapse after relapse, enduring astonishing agonies.
  page 13

- We knew our addiction was progressive; it was only getting worse and worse. And we realized, at least intellectually, that it could one day be fatal.
  page 13

- Many of use made the mistake of thinking we could keep on using because we didn't look so hopeless on the outside. But it wasn't about our outsides, it was about how hopeless we felt inside.
  Page 13

- In Step One, we made an honest catalog of our misery. We shined a light on all the reasons we had to quite doing drugs and admitted all of it to ourselves
  Page 14

- So what was the whole story? What happened to us? Most of the time, our sponsors asked us to write it all out.  We thought all the way back to the first time we smoked weed or had a beer.
  Page 14

- You'll hear a lot about powerlessness and unmanageability as you get sober. Recognizing both in your life is key to accepting you're an addict -- and starting to recover.
  Page 14

- This is what we mean by powerlessness. Needing to stop, vowing to stop, and not being able to.
  Page 14

- Out willpower was utterly useless. Crystal meth was much more powerful than we were. We couldn't control it.
  Page 14

- This is the most insidious thing about our disease: At some point, we were unable to stop; something mysterious took control of us. Over and over, we'd tell ourselves that this time would be different. Yet over and over, this time was only worse than the time before. And over an over, knowing that more pain awaited, we used again anyway.
  Page 15

- But that adventurous spirit started long before. It's not that alcohol, marijuana, and poppers are gateways drugs; we're just the sort of people who love running through gates.
  page 15

- Our fellows called it the ABCs: "Alcohol becomes cyrstal"
  page 15

- But ultimately our issue was addiction, not any particular chemical. That's why we learned to say "a drug is a drug is a drug." Some people may be able to use other drugs, but we couldn't.
  Page 15

- A grim truth dawned on us.  We thought we used because of all the horrible stuff that happened to us. In face, horrible stuff kept happening to use because we used. Every story is different.  There is no set checklist of unmanagability.  Each of us leaves our own unique trail of disasters behind us.  We'll all born with a different tolerance for suffering, but suffer we do, each in our own way,
  Page 16

- And that usually means we start writing.  Some addicts got it down in a narrative. Others go through a workbook, answering focused questions.  The main thing is to put down on paper the central facts of our story.
  Page 16

- Addicts have a built in forgetter so we need to make a very speicifc movie we can play whenever we feel triggered to use.  Living in Step One, we have the film ready to roll all the time, so we can answer any craving with a resounding "not today".
  Page 17

- We needed concrete, working definitions of these ideas, based on our experience: What did powerlessness and unmanageabilty mean to us?  And how exactly, had we gone insane?  Not jiust the paranoia, the hallucinations, the psychosis so many of us experienced.  Could we see that our day-to-dat choices in active addiction were just bonkers?
  Page 17

- Our fellows tell us this is the only step we have to work perfectly; if the day comes when we forget our powerlessness and unmanageability, we're likely to pick up.
  Page 17

- We don't reserve a place for them in our fantasy life or future "what ifs" or leave a back door open by maintaining relationships with people we used with.  Keep crystal in our life would be delusional; thinking we have any power over it almost ensures we'll go back to using.
  Page 17


** Step 2:
- But even those of use who are religious have a "God problem" -- we've been playing God in our own tiny hells.
  page 20

- Focus on just staying vlean, they said, and let the program itself be your Higher Power.  Our HP could be GOD -- the group of drug addicts who were helping stay away from meth a day at a time.  Or it might be the good orderly direction we were learning from them.  Maybe it was the gift of desperation which week by week was becomimg the gift of dignity.
  page 18

- Step two doesn't promise we will become sane again.  The program isn't magic -- there will be plenty of days when our emotions get the better of us.
  Page 18

- We've put down the drug, but can't change our thinking pattern so easily.  It can be tough to live in thee acceptance of step one and stick to the commitment not to pick up when our moods keep swinging so wildly and our thoughts are racing around the clock.
  page 18

- Addicts like to say that insanity is "doing the same thing over and over expecting a diffferent result".  Time and again, knowing we'd end up in the same sad mess, we picked up crystal.
  Page 19

- "This time will be different" we said knowing in our hearts that this time was be absolutely the same or possibly worse.
  page 19

- Step two doesn't say that we'll become sane for the first time, but that our sanity can be restored. Knowing this helps us discard our old attitude of victimhood.
  Page 20

- Guiding us through this step, our sponsors ask us to think back over our active addiction. In truth, we were insane long before we used; the problem, as our friends in AA say, was "the thinking that preceeded the drinking".  What were some of our crazy excuses to use drugs?  What sorts of things did we do as we struggled to get by and find our next high? We knew what would happen every time we picked up but did it anyway.  Life became a complete calamity, yet we were still sure we know how best to handle our problem.
  Page 19

- To bring this point home, our sponsors might ask us to seek out people we relate to and ask them to tell us about their HP. For some that power is the God they grew up with. For others, its the majesty of science, the inspiring genius of a pop diva, the spirit of a dead grandparent, the wind whispering in the trees, or the circle of recovering addicts in their home group.
  Page 20

- So when our sponsors tell us not to stress out about finding a HP, they mean it.  Only keep an open mind, they say. Our growing faith in the program and the time we spend pursuing the Good Orderly Direction of the steps will naturally lead us to deeper reflection on the question
  page 21

- It's not *the* power but *a* power -- something we find we can rely on, the "God of *our* understanding" described in the rest of the steps.  Our relation with it isn't fixed; it will change as we change.
  Page 21

- Religious people, asking for concrete help from the God of their undarstaning, feel their convinctions deepen ... Agnostic people, on the other hand, often become more passionately so. They go deeper into the mystery of the Universe; not knowing for them is the whole beautiful point; any god they could thoroughly comprehend just wouldn't be powerful enough.  Athiests find their own sublime spirituality, drawing power from their ancestors and heroes, or from astral mechanics, or the changing of the seasons, or the mighty rhythm of the pounding surf
  Page 21

** Step 3

- Given the magnitude of the job, the authors of the twelve steps offered us a brilliant and beautifully honest caveat.  They didn't write "Turned out will and our lives ..." No. Just "*Made a decision* to turn our will and our lives over..."  No one who's ever lived has always been in total concert with the rhythm of the universe.
  Page 22



** Step 4:
- Falling prey to self-sufficiency or isolation, we may eventually deny the truth and use again.  That's where Steps Two and Three come in. They give us a new spiritual focus, a plan, and a network of like-minded people we can count on.  We're no longer alone with our problem.
  page 26

- What we're making is a truth inventory.
  page 27

- When we've tried to get sober before, we were often driven by shame or remorse about the thing's we'd done.  It didn't work; guilt by itself is truly a wasted emotion. What if we could unlearn the behaviors that caused the remorse in the first place?
  page 27

- Addiction is that rare illness that can be arrested if we treat the symptoms, in this case our warped behaviors.
  page 27

- When the work is challenging, we remember what our fellows have said: Like everything else in the Steps, this is the way for us to find freedom.
  page 27

- And though we might not have had a part in the incident, we always have a part in the resentment about it. When it comes to events that are far in the past or otherwise abstract, continuing to nurse the grudge is entirely on us.
  page 29

- We call these character defects or shortcomings, but a lot of us find it more useful to think of them as defense mechanisms or negative reactions.  How do we behave when we feel *cornered*?
  page 29

- Most of our fears, it turns out, are overblown. They're lies we've told ourselves to explain our flawed understanding of life.
  page 30

- A lot of us resist writing about our assets, much less talking about them. We don't mind telling people what a piece of shit we are, but looking someone in the eye and saying we're kind or funny or loving is impossible.  But an honest inventory requires listing everything -- the bad and the good.  We need to remember why we're worth saving.
  Page 32

** Step 5
- We're leading someone into the dark, dusty corners of our past, and pointing out all the clutter we've hidden away.
