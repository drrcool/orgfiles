/Title/: Living Sober
/Author/: Alcoholics Anonymous World Services
/Year/:1975


In recovering from alcholism, we found that we needed a /balanced/ diet of ideas, even if some of them did ntot look, at first, as enjoyable as other.  Like good food, good ideas did us no good unless we made intelligent use of them.

We are also convinced, after countless attempts we made to prove otherwise, that alcoholism is incurable.

Our drinking caused many of us to choose our friends according to how much they drank.   We even changed friends when we felt we had "outgrown" their drinking styles.  We preferred "real drinkers" to people who just took one or two.
