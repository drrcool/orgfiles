#+title: Man in the Arena Speech

* The quote
Teddy Roosevelt gave this speech on April 23, 1909 at the Sorbonne.  I originally discovered it through [[id:fc86dd4e-0ee1-4d36-ba63-35e1eaa3b1b0][Brene Brown]].

Is not the critic who counts;
not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles;
or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;
who strives valiantly;
who errs,
who comes short again and again,
because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;
but who does actually strive to do the deeds;
who knows great enthusiams,
the great devotions;
who spends himself in a worthy cause;
who at the best knows, in the end, the triumph of high achviement,
and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,
so that his place never be with those cold and timid souls  who neighter know victory nor defeat.
