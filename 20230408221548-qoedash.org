* TODAY:
* Holding Pen
** TODO if you set exclude and include filters to the same value, we crash badly
** SOMEDAY Move the summary tab to druidSQL queries
** SOMEDAY When we filter, the metric Breakdown (and likely other subcomponent breakdowns) show all the options, not just the options displayed in the first chart
** Make a topN filtered worst-offender pie chart
** TODO Worst Offenders table view :@work:#qoedash:
** TODO Ranking Chart Time series view :@work:#qoedash:
** TODO Add =nrdapp_version= to all the qoedash datasets
*** Notes from meeting: June 20
**** Any other versions to add in the meantime?
***** DPI version: in startup logblob

** TODO make =chipset= case insensitive.  (In practice, we could do that to most splits)
*** Probably best to do this in the query itself. Check to see if druid allows an UPPER or similar operator
*** We want to avoid doing this in the code since
**** Some metrics like the histogram ones we can't really aggregate after the fact
**** We probably want to ensure that we can update the filters to do this as well and the preloads
**** We would need to update the preload scripts to do an uppercase.  How hard is that fuck
** TODO arrows don't work for datepicker
** TODO the custom table ordering is not as intuitive as I would like
** TODO Clicking the left/right arrows on the date popup causes it to close. Same behavior when selecting on the month or the year
** TODO handle the new session success logic
** SOMEDAY add ads plan to PQS:
    This isn't as simple as I expected.  The largest issue is our aggregate doesn't include plan information, which means that we would have to re-engineer the aggregate even before adding to the report table.  For now, I am going to pass on this.
** TODO Add game play start component chart to gaming views
** TODO add =utc_date= to the axis label on qoedash
** TODO add ttr_events
