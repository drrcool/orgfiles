* TODO Move the summary tab to druidSQL queries
* TODO when we add a filter from the LegendBox, no chart reload is triggered
- When I use exclude, this works.
- When I use show all, this works.
- When I use keep only, it doesn't trigger a reload.  This *may* be due to the keep only is being added on top of the topN.  My guess is that we're not doing the topN query when we
  are adding this query.


* STUDY do filters work at all?
- Initial look says that these filters *are* being applied.

* TODO When we filter, the metric Breakdown (and likely other subcomponent breakdowns) show all the options, not just the options displayed in the first chart
* Make a topN filtered worst-offender pie chart
* TODO quantile breakdown chart (maybe others) tooltip disappears at bottom of chart :@work:#qoedash:
* TODO add click handler for bar chart and others :@work:#qoedash:

* DONE use the time series queries twice to get the data for comparison charts.  For the comparison, just add DELTA_TIME to the dates to do the cross comparison.

  Decided both of these could be better done with existing chart types
