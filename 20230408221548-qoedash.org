* TODO if you set exclude and include filters to the same value, we crash badly
* SOMEDAY Move the summary tab to druidSQL queries
* SOMEDAY When we filter, the metric Breakdown (and likely other subcomponent breakdowns) show all the options, not just the options displayed in the first chart
* Make a topN filtered worst-offender pie chart
* TODO add click handler for bar chart and others :@work:#qoedash:
* TODO Worst Offenders table view :@work:#qoedash:
* TODO Ranking Chart Time series view :@work:#qoedash:
* TODO Add =nrdapp_version= to all the qoedash datasets
* TODO make =chipset= case insensitive.  (In practice, we could do that to most splits)
* TODO explorer doesn't work for PQS
* TODO arrows don't work for datepicker
* DONE seems like the update script is updating the timeBoundary but the topN is finding no data that
CLOSED: [2023-05-30 Tue 09:19]
*** This happens because the timeBoundary calculation is done with the full dimensionality data set but the queries primarily hit low_dim but that dataset is created second in the yaml.  The easiest solution would be to swap the order to make lowdim first in the yaml.
*** Added this reordering on May 30
* TODO the custom table ordering is not as intuitive as I would like
