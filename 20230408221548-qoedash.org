* TODAY:
* Holding Pen
** TODO if you set exclude and include filters to the same value, we crash badly
** SOMEDAY Move the summary tab to druidSQL queries
** SOMEDAY When we filter, the metric Breakdown (and likely other subcomponent breakdowns) show all the options, not just the options displayed in the first chart
** Make a topN filtered worst-offender pie chart
** TODO Worst Offenders table view :@work:#qoedash:
** TODO Ranking Chart Time series view :@work:#qoedash:
** TODO Add =nrdapp_version= to all the qoedash datasets
*** Notes from meeting: June 20
**** Any other versions to add in the meantime?
***** DPI version: in startup logblob
** TODO make =chipset= case insensitive.  (In practice, we could do that to most splits)
*** Probably best to do this in the query itself. Check to see if druid allows an UPPER or similar operator
*** We want to avoid doing this in the code since
**** Some metrics like the histogram ones we can't really aggregate after the fact
**** We probably want to ensure that we can update the filters to do this as well and the preloads
**** We would need to update the preload scripts to do an uppercase.  How hard is that fuck
** TODO arrows don't work for datepicker
** TODO the custom table ordering is not as intuitive as I would like
** TODO Clicking the left/right arrows on the date popup causes it to close. Same behavior when selecting on the month or the year
** SOMEDAY add ads plan to PQS:
    - This isn't as simple as I expected.  The largest issue is our aggregate doesn't include plan information, which means that we would have to re-engineer the aggregate even before adding to the report table.  For now, I am going to pass on this.
** TODO add =utc_date= to the axis label on qoedash
* Triage:
** Error when reading PQS for some queries
  - https://netflix.slack.com/archives/C04FTKVSZGX/p1687901826435599
* Versioning change
** Get nrdapp version in Asap
** Add =os_version= to qoedash

* Automotive
    - We will be supporting automative devices. May need to add a new category of devices.  Make sure the new devices are being added to the new category in PDM.
* Policy Error
    - Follow up with Venaktesh about the final UDF.  Which is the final UDF that used.
* Arian's emails for PQS
    - get subscribed to the email about PQS drivers.  Should we see about how to add these results to the dashboard
* Add DNR to PQS
    - Data is logged in DCMS, flag is called RETIRED.   The flag was only started being set in June (ish), so snapshotting the current value retroactively for a backfill for a bit makes a little sense.

* TODO PQS time series and metric breakdown do odd scaling when the window is expanded

* Why does this link fail:
    - https://qoedash.prod.netflix.net/ecosystem?metric=active_devices_28d&topNMetric=active_devices_28d&client_platform_name=Legacy&splitBy=device_type_extended_name
** TODO add ttr_events
** TODO feature request: add ability to drop list of =device_type_id= in the filter box and have them all selected
** DONE with the cloudgaming header, the buttons are misplaced
CLOSED: [2023-08-08 Tue 14:55]
