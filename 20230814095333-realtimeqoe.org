#+title: RealTimeQoE
* Integrate metrics into RTCloudGaming
** Adding second screen controller metrics into measures library (Vache)
*** Now added them into RT QOE
*** Hardest part: understanding what metrics to make from them
**** How to normalize
**** What to split by
**** Mantis ASL:
***** stack language
****** Each Comma separates a command
*** To edit the code, click the edit code button.
**** Code is in a JSON blog
**** Undertoolbar, each entry in the list is a row of controls
***** can also be unique to a specific tab
**** Views are the tabs
**** All the queries are held in one central location, you can then use the title of the cell to find the query you need.
**** query is the same ASL used in Atlas
**** winDirection directs the user to which direction is a "win" for the metric
**** When splitting by a aggregate, we want to specify the legend
***** Legend query
****** $(maxControllers), :legend
**** Then use the title from the query config to add it to the dashboard
*** Adding Dimensions:
**** Copy from another dimension and then edit
***** tag = dimensionName
***** adhoc: do we want users to be able add a value?
***** selectAll: select all matching values from a search value
***** noListFilter: don't need to refresh the filter whenever someone starts to type
*** Adding a binned distribution:
**** For percentile metrics, the :sum gives the count
