#+title: Project Idea -- Quick Plot

* Idea
Create a web app that takes a csv file via upload, processes the data, stores it in a tidy format, then allows users to plot.

* Implementation Parts:
** File upload
** File parsing
** CSV to JSON
** UI to select dimensions and metrics
** UI to select chart type
** Chart components to render selected chart
** Allow the user to specify the date/time format


* Questions:
** What framework to use for charting?
*** If we want to use it at work, we'll want to use appropriate choices
**** Will this work with the new server architecture?
*** For public use we will need to use D3, ChartJS, or some other library
